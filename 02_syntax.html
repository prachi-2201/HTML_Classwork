    <h1>Html Syntax Explained</h1>

    <p>Every HTML document begins with a HTML document tag. Although this is not mandatory, it is a good convention to
        start the document with this below-mentioned tag. Please refer to the HTML Doctypes article for more information
        related to Doctypes.</p>
    <h3>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</h3>
    <h3>&lt;html&gt;</h3>
    <p>Every HTML code must be enclosed between basic HTML tags. It begins with &lt;html&gt; and ends with

        &lt;html&gt;tag.</p>

    <h3>&lt;head&gt;</h3>
    <p> The head tag comes next which contains all the header information of the web page or documents like the
        title of the page and other miscellaneous information. This information is enclosed within the head tag which
        opens with &lt;head&gt; and ends with &lt;head&gt;. The contents will of this tag will be explained in the later
        sections of the
        course.</p>
    <h3>&lt;title&gt;</h3>
    <p>We can mention the title of a web page using the &lt;title&gt; tag. This is header information and hence is
        mentioned within the header tags. The tag begins with &lt;title&gt; and ends with &lt;title&gt;.</p>

    <h3>&lt;body&gt;</h3>
    <p>Next step is the most important of all the tags we have learned so far. The body tag contains the actual
        body of the page which will be visible to all the users. This opens with
        &lt;body&gt; and ends with &lt;body&gt;. All content enclosed within this tag will be shown on the web page be
        it writings
        or images or audio or videos or even links. We will see later in the section how using various tags we may
        insert mentioned contents into our web pages.</p>
    <p>The whole pattern of the code will look something like the below code example.</p>
